/**
 * One species, or one of its forms — a dex number wearing a name. Naming a form or a region asks for one the species
 * actually has and hands back the Pokemon that form is, so a filter can say which form it means and still write the
 * one number PGSharp stores: `toJSON` sees to that, leaving `JSON.stringify` to emit the dex number and nothing else.
 *
 * A species is built up a link at a time, and two things travel down the chain. One is the cursor — what a marker
 * applies to. `isShinyEligible`, `isNotShinyEligible`, `doesSpawn`, `doesNotSpawn`, `isReleased`, `isNotReleased`,
 * `isLegendary`, `isMythical`, `isBaby`, `isUltraBeast`, `isRegional` and `isNotRegional` all land on whatever was
 * declared last — the species itself until a form or a region is named, and that form or region afterwards. These are
 * properties of the form rather than the species, since a species can have a shiny where its regional variant does
 * not. Undeclared reads as eligible, so a species says nothing until it has something to say. A Legendary, Mythical,
 * Baby or Ultra Beast is one the wild never turns up, so those four stop it spawning too — Meltan the lone Mythical
 * that does, saying `doesSpawn` after to put it back. A Regional is the odd one out: it still spawns, only somewhere
 * particular, so it leaves spawning alone; a form inherits it, `isNotRegional` handing one back to the wild at large.
 *
 * The other is the target — what a new form or region hangs off. `addForm`, `addForms`, `addRegion` and `addRegions`
 * declare peers at the current target and leave it where it is, so listing several is listing siblings. `withForm`
 * and `withRegion` declare one and descend into it, moving the target so what follows nests beneath — the Paldean
 * breeds under Paldean Tauros, the Galarian modes under Galarian Darmanitan.
 *
 * ```js
 * new Pokemon(128).withRegion(PALDEA).doesNotSpawn().addForms('COMBAT_BREED', 'BLAZE_BREED', 'AQUA_BREED');
 * ```
