/**
 * A filter's species list, checked, narrowed and collapsed to one entry per species. A form or a region the species
 * does not have has already thrown by the time we are called, so what is left to catch is a name pokemon.js does not
 * define at all, which reads as undefined and would reach the backup as a null where a species should be. The value is
 * all we are handed — the constant's name is gone by then — so the error gives the position to look at. The species
 * arrive as a Set, taken here in the order they were written so the position and the first-survivor rule below mean
 * what they say.
 *
 * Every `keep` given has to hold for an entry to stay, which is how a filter drops what has no shiny to find or what
 * the wild never turns up. They run before the list collapses, so a species listed twice — once as a form that
 * survives them and once as one that does not — keeps the form that survives rather than whichever came first.
 *
 * A form is a Pokemon of its own carrying the dex number of the species it belongs to, since that number is all
 * PGSharp stores, so a list naming several forms of one species names that number several times. The names are worth
 * keeping — they say which forms the list is for — but the repeats are not, so the first of each number survives and
 * the rest go, leaving the list PGSharp itself would write.
